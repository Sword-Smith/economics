# Economics
This is a collection of economic resources and links introducing neoclassical and Austrian economics that I have watched and found insightful or an honest representation of a central economic perspective.

A video on this list does not necessarily mean that I support the entire message delivered, only that I consider it a good resource presenting a given topic.

This is mainly a list of videos, but books and articles are also welcome here.

Austrian Economics has made two significant contributions to the science of economics: "Austrian business cycle theory" about the dynamic effects of excessive money printing, and "calculation and socialism" about the role that prices play in disseminating and condensing information about scarcity and superior production methods.

## Praxeology
Praxeology is the deductive study of human actions as purposeful behavior. One key difference between Austrian and neoclassical economics is that Austrian economics relies more on deduction than neoclassical economics does. Austrians claim that there are many questions we don't need to test since they follow logically from irrefutable axioms about humans.
