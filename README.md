# Economics
This is a collection of economic resources and links introducing neoclassical and Austrian economics that I have watched and found insightful or an honest representation of a central economic perspective.

A video on this list does not necessarily mean that I support the entire message delivered, only that I consider it a good resource presenting a given topic.

This is mainly a list of videos, but books and articles are also welcome here.

## Introduction to Economics
#### Free to Choose, part 1
https://youtu.be/dngqR9gcDDw
PBS, Milton Friedman, 1980

What has capitalism given us, what role does it play in our lives, both as consumers and producers? How does capitalism coordinate production?

#### Applying Economics to American History

Economics for High School Students, Thomas E. Woods, Jr., 2009

What are the historical sources of our wealth? Is it wealth that drives politics or the other way around?

Mises U, Shawn Ritenour, 2019

How do you make a flourless chocolate cake, can you scale this production, and what do you need if you want to scale it?

#### Money
https://youtu.be/B-70fyIzgLk
Mises U, Lucas M. Engelhardt, 2016

What role does money play in the economy, and why is it useful? How money arises in the market, without government intervention and what qualities money should have: divisible, durable, fungible, scarce, portable, widely accepted. Also has a short discussion on the consequences of money printing and how it distorts prices, salaries, and production, thus introducing some content of Austrian business cycle theory and the cantillong effect.  

## Advanced Austrian Economics
Austrian Economics has made two significant contributions to the science of economics: "Austrian business cycle theory" about the dynamic effects of excessive money printing, and "calculation and socialism" about the role that prices play in disseminating and condensing information about scarcity and superior production methods.

#### Calculation and socialism

Mises U, Joseph T. Salerno, 2013

#### Austrian business cycle theory
https://youtu.be/7cs490NJr5g
Mises U, Jonathan Newman, 2021

Why you should blame central banks for the current situation of scarcity.

#### Austrian Alternatives to Conventional Economic Statistics
https://youtu.be/9x5djkog1xI
Mises U, Jonathan Newman, 2019

What are mainstream eocnomic statistical indicators missing according to an Austrian economic perspective?

#### Different types of goods from an economic perspective
https://youtu.be/9VMNJowUoGk
Mises U, Walter Block, 2011

Are there certain kinds of goods that can only be provided by the government, or are there private alternatives to their provision? Walter Block on externalities and different types of goods, excludability and rivalrousness. Good speech showing the difference between neoclassical and Austrian approaches.

#### Only the Austrians Understand Interest Rates
https://youtu.be/tDkNPNSgiaY
Mises Circle, Robert P. Murphy, 2010

Good parallel between oil prices and interest rates

## Money
#### History and causes of inflation
https://youtu.be/afWqKcqntfs

Dr. Martenson's Crash Course, Chapter 10, 2009. Important resource for me in realizing that inflation is a deliberate policy, not a force of nature. We don't **have** to live in a world of inflation, we **can** escape it.

#### How an economy grows and why it crashes
https://epdf.pub/how-an-economy-grows-and-why-it-crashes.html

Irwin Schiff and Peter Schiff, 2010

A cartoon describing the conception of an economy from a "state of nature". Especially the introduction is good. Later on it comments on specific and current economic questions which may not be as timeless as the introduction. Heavy emphasis on the role of money.

## Public Choice
Public Choice Theory is the analysis of the political decision process through the lens of economics and incentives.

#### Political Decentralization as a Road to Anarcho-Capitalism
https://youtu.be/QuXZJibu4zk
Mises U, Ryan McMaken, 2021

## Praxeology
Praxeology is the deductive study of human actions as purposeful behavior. One key difference between Austrian and neoclassical economics is that Austrian economics relies more on deduction than neoclassical economics does. Austrians claim that there are many questions we don't need to test since they follow logically from irrefutable axioms about humans.

#### Introduction to Praxeology
https://youtu.be/aTXxvWa11Lg
Mises U, Hans-Herman Hoppe, 2011

#### On Man, Nature, Truth, and Justice
https://youtu.be/in3sacFHcck
Mises U, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, 2015

## Ancap
Anarcho-capitalism is the moral conviction that all state power is illegitimate since it is a violation of the non-agression principle (NAP) which claims that it is immoral to initiate (but not respond to) violence against other people.

#### The state is too dangerous to tolerate
https://youtu.be/RILDjo4EXV8
Mises U, Robert Higgs, 2013

An emotional appeal against the existence of government.

## Hardcore stuff
#### Basic Economics, by Thomas Sowell

Best book on economics I ever read.

#### Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand

Good book introducing "objectivism" which is a philosophy that combines psychology with economics and is very efficient at identifying certain negative psychological traits that are common in society.

#### Murray Rothbard's, Economics 101 (whole course)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKjJE86mQRtuTPQ1Fm4isMG1w9fTWBu-X

A collection of eight lectures by Murray N. Rothbard, spanning from the 1970s to the early 1990s. He is speaking in a small classroom setting, explaining economics from the ground up, and systematically in the manner of a classic 101 course on the topic—but with a revolutionary approach.

#### Murray Rothbard's Introduction to Microeconomics (whole course)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKjJE86mQRtvCN4vEsxYEntK0MFbsAv4t

Presented by Murray N. Rothbard in 1986 at New York Polytechnic University. Recorded by Hans-Hermann Hoppe.
